# Contributing to the Cyberpunk Mod Database

## Typos, errors, additions

If you find any errors or missing information, pull requests are 
very welcome. Alternatively, you can email me the details at 
[eve@aeonoftime.com](mailto:eve@aeonoftime.com).

## Mod tag suggestions and changes

One of the core aspects of the database is the tagging system, 
as this makes it possible to find the mods containing the things
you're looking for. 

I am always happy for any contributions you may have:

- Suggesting new tags.
- Mis-tagged mods, item categories or items.
- Missing tags.

See the [tagging reference](tagging-reference.md) for an overview
of which tags are currently known in the database.

Create a pull request, or send the files to me via email at
[eve@aeonoftime.com](mailto:eve@aeonoftime.com).

## Adding new mods

Please see the [mod contribution guide](contributing-mods.md).
