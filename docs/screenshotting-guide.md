# Screenshotting

## Prerequisites

Use the save games from the [Mod DB sources](https://github.com/Mistralys/cyberpunk-mod-db-sources/blob/main/Save%20Games/savegames.md).
There are instructions and requirements there to set up the game 
for them.

## Step 1: Prepare the outfits

In the wardrobe, create and save the outfits you want to screenshot.
This way they can be switched without having to reconfigure the
photo mode setup every time.

> It also makes it possible to take screenshots with the character
> staying in the exact same pose and position.

## Step 2: Set up the photo mode

- Use the AMM "Tools" menu to set the time to approximately 15:20.
- Use one of the three pose slots stored in the savegame:
  1. Pose 1: Full body shot
  2. Pose 2: Upper body shot
  3. Pose 3: Lower body shot
- Make sure that the floor line is level with the photo mode's dotted guide lines.
- Once everything is set, avoid rotating the camera with the right mouse button. 
  Instead, use the character's position sliders to adjust the pose.
