# Cyberpunk 2077 Clothing Mods Database

Curated database of Cyberpunk 2077 clothing mods, stored in individual JSON files
and with custom screenshots for each mod.

## Accessing the Database

At its simplest level, you can include the project as a submodule in your own
project, and load the JSON files manually. The database was initially created
to be used in a PHP project however, so if you have access to PHP, you can
use the separate project [Cyberpunk 2077 Clothing Mods Database PHP](https://github.com/Mistralys/cyberpunk-mod-db-php).
